#exit status (command)

If a command is not found, the exit status shall be 127.

If the command name is found, but it is not an executable utility,
the exit status shall be 126.

If a command fails during word expansion or redirection,
its exit status shall be greater than zero.

Internally, for purposes of deciding whether a command exits
with a non-zero exit status, the shell shall recognize
the entire status value retrieved for the command by the
equivalent of the wait() function WEXITSTATUS macro.

When reporting the exit status with the special parameter '?',
the shell shall report the full eight bits of exit status available.

The exit status of a command that terminated because
it received a signal shall be reported as greater than 128.
